A web app for writing markdown notes, built with SvelteKit and Supabase. The notes are then encrypted with a user defined key, and stored on Supabase. 

User authentication is pretty simple - you log in with just a username and key.

Visually, it's inspired by Obsidian and VSCode. You can toggle the note view between "Edit", "Split", and "Preview", and organise your notes in folders.
