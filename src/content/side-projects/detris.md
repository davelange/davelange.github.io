This was the hackathon project that we at finiam built for [ETHAmsterdam](https://amsterdam.ethglobal.com/) in April 2022, that was selected as one of the 13 finalists. It's a playable NFT that can run an instance of a game of Tetris. How do we do this? The asset the Detris NFT is retrieving is actually our implementation of the game of Tetris, stored on IPFS. We can then display this asset using an iframe. And since OpenSea supports iframes too, we can actually [play Tetris on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xbdc105c068715d57860702da9fa0c5ead11fba51/2).
