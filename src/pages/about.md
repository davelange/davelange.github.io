# About me

As a frontend developer, I've worked with a bunch of different frameworks and technologies - React, Svelte, Next.js, SvelteKit, Wordpress, or just plain HTML/CSS/JS. Regardless of the tech used, my goal is always to provide the end user with a great experience.

I've been working at [Finiam](https://finiam.com) for the past couple of years, where I've also had the chance to work in web3 related projects. In particular, I've had a bunch of experience building frontends for dapps and other apps that need to interact with the blockchain and user wallets, both on L1 Ethereum and Starknet.
