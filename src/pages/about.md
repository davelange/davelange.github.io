# About me

As a frontend developer, I've worked with a bunch of different frameworks and technologies - React, Svelte, Next.js, SvelteKit, Wordpress, Vue, or just plain HTML/CSS/JS. These projects have involved a variety of different backend solutions, such as Phoenix, NodeJS, PHP, and Jamstack style tech such as headless CMSs or Supabase.

Regardless of the tech used, my goal is always to provide the end user with a great experience.

I've been working at [Finiam](https://finiam.com) for the past couple of years, where I've also had the chance to work in web3 related projects. In particular, I've had a bunch of experience building frontends for dapps and other apps that need to interact with the blockchain and user wallets, both on L1 Ethereum and Starknet.

## Open source things

I've also contributed to some open source projects and events, such as:

### [Starknet book](https://book.starknet.io/#starknet_book_authors)

The Starknet Book is an open source curriculum created to teach the Cairo programming language and Starknet development. It's built by the Starknet community, and I've contributed to the [StarknetJS](https://github.com/0xs34n/starknet.js) and [starknet-react](https://github.com/apibara/starknet-react) sections, drawing on my experience using these tools.

### [Secrets](https://github.com/finiam/secrets.finiam.com)

A simple web app we build at Finiam. It transmits E2E encrypted messages safely and ephemerally. You can check it out [here](https://secrets.finiam.com/).

### [starknet-react](https://github.com/apibara/starknet-react)

This is a collection of React providers and hooks for Starknet. Along with many others, I've contributed to making it a little bit easier to build Starknet dapps. I also gave a talk on this and indexing, in a [Starknet Meetup](https://twitter.com/wearefiniam/status/1654517948315234306).

### [Coimbra.Blockchain](https://twitter.com/Coimblockchain)

Coimbra Blockchain kindly invited me to give a talk on [_dApp Frontends_](https://www.youtube.com/live/qqlRjpXY_Pc?feature=share&t=193).

### [Falcone Options](https://falcone.finiam.com/)

An educational resource we build at Finiam, onboarding users to what options trading is, and [Carmine Finance](https://carmine.finance/).
